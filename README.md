# GA
The code repo for my GA


### ROADMAP

- select a simple test dataset for end metrics
- build the model, and get it working on a single node
- run the model on multiple nodes
- run the model on docker
- build a k8s controller to manage pods
- run the dataset on the two systems and extract metrics
- analyse the data in GA
